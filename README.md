# The Mapty app

This app created with OOP, Geolocation API, External Libraries, and Local Storage. This project is not finished yet and I am adding new features to it. I made this simple project according to Jonas Schmedtmann's training video on UDEMY.

## Setup

If you are living in IRAN, you have to use VPN for getting response massage from API that i used in this project.
We are going to execute this project using live-server.

```
$ cd ../Mapty
$ npm i live-server
$ live-server
```
